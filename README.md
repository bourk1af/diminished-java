# diminished-java
Object oriented programming language created for a class.

Jay Ligatti's description of the Diminished Java programming language:
"DJ is a small programming language similar to Java. DJ has been
designed to try to satisfy two opposing goals:
1. DJ is a complete object-oriented programming language (OOPL):
(a) you can express any algorithm in DJ (more precisely, we
say DJ is Turing complete; any Turing machine can be encoded
as a DJ program), and (b) DJ includes all the core features of
OOPLs like Java.
2. DJ is simple, with only core features included. DJ can
therefore be compiled straightforwardly; we can design and
implement a working (inefficient but otherwise complete) DJ
compiler in one semester."
